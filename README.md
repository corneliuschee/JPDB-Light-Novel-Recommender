# üìö Project Overview

The **JPDB Light Novel Recommender System** is a simple command-line personalised Japanese reading tool that recommends *light novels optimized for your current vocabulary level*. By combining your **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcard vocabulary** with **[JPDB](https://jpdb.io) vocabulary frequency information**, 
it identifies novels that are suitable at your current vocabulary coverage and retention.

The system uses **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to generate personalized rankings for each novel based on:

- Your known vocabulary coverage. 
- Word frequency ranks for each novel.  
- Novel difficulty, sentence length, and length metrics (from [JPDB](https://jpdb.io/novel-difficulty-list)). 
- Weighted Anki flashcard review history to prioritize familiarity.

It outputs a **ranked list of light novels (top 5)** that best match your current Japanese level compared to generalised recommendations online that uses JLPT levels.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Usage

This project relies on personal Anki flashcard data and a custom JPDB dataset stored in a local SQLite database.  

Because these datasets and database schemas are unique to my setup, **installation and database seeding instructions are not provided**.  

If you wish to adapt or use this project, you will need to:

- Export and prepare your own Anki vocabulary data in a compatible format  
- Collect or generate a JPDB light novel dataset  
- Adjust the database schema and code to fit your data  

This repository is primarily for personal use and demonstration of the recommender system concept.

## üí≠ Reflections

This project helped to visualise my Anki vocabulary statistics through PowerBI, working with SQLite databases, practice EDA and learning about unsupervised learning (NMF) & Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Main learning points
- Working with SQLite database using SQLAlchemy
- Unsupervised learning (NMF) & Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- PowerBI visualisations

### Challenges
- JPDB API documentation did not cover some API endpoints required for the project (eg. get vocabulary frequency rank), worked around by reverse-engineering parts of the API workflow by inspecting network traffic and testing undocumented endpoints.
- **API rate limits** required batching and delays when pulling vocab data, as web scraping is [not officially allowed](https://jpdb.io/terms-of-use) on the JPDB.io website.
- Ensuring the **recommender scores were meaningful** with limited vocabulary data (3.8k flashcards at time of completion) and light novel data (1475 novels only).
- To keep the project manageable at my current level of knowledge, I limited the number of features used in the recommender model, dropping several (e.g., ‚ÄòUnique Kanji (used once)‚Äô, ‚ÄòUnique Words‚Äô) to avoid unnecessary complexity.‚Äù
